Write a Windows application or script (for example using AutoIT) that performs the following steps:

1. Open the windows services manager (services.msc)
2. For each service in the list, extract and print the following data:
  - service name
  - service description
  - service status


HINTS:

a. run as administrator to use automation on the services app
b. the "standard" tab in the services manager uses standard Windows controls
